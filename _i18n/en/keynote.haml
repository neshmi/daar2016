        %h3 Pedro Santos
        %p Pedro Santos has been Head of the Competence Center for Cultural Heritage Digitization since 2012. Before he was Deputy Head of the Department of Industrial Applications, today Department of Interactive Engineering Technologies.
        %p In the course of various projects in the field of digital preservation of cultural heritage objects and of the increasing demand for mass-scale 3D digitization in this field, his department develops the world's first approach for fast, economic, and automated 3D digitization of cultural heritage with emphasis on capturing optical material properties.
        %p Pedro Santos, who has been researcher at Fraunhofer IGD since 2002, studied computer science at the University of Darmstadt and the Technical University of Lisbon. At present he is also attaining his PhD on the subject of “fast, economic, and automated 3D digitization of cultural heritage” at Technical University Darmstadt.
        %p During his professional career he was involved in the development of the first immersive CAD modelling systems to be used for the early stages of product development as well as in the design of "see-through head-mounted" displays", mobile applications in augmented reality and optical "marker-based" and "marker-less" tracking systems.
        %p Pedro Santos is author and co-author of over 60 publications as well as reviewer for the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the European Association for Computer Graphics (Eurographics), the IEEE Computer Society and other organizations.
